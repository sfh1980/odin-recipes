     <p>Below we will look at the ingredients needed to make this wonderful 
        baked mac and cheese and the steps to put it all together.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</ul>
    <ul>1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, drained and chopped</ul>
    <ul>1 (16 ounce) package sharp Cheddar cheese, sliced </ul>
    <ul>Â½ cup milk</ul>
    <ul>1 (4 ounce) packet saltine crackers, crushed</ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol> <strong>Step 1</strong> 

        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</ol>
    <ol> <strong>Step 2</strong> 

            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</ol>

        Spread half the macaroni into a 9x13-inch casserole dish; top with half the tomatoes and half the Cheddar cheese. Repeat layering with remaining macaroni, tomatoes, and Cheddar cheese. Pour milk over entire casserole; sprinkle with crushed crackers.</ol>
